I am a first-year master's student in Nutritional Epidemiology at Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health. My research interests focus on the genetic, lifestyle, and metabolic determinants of digestive diseases and cancers. I am passionate about integrating cutting-edge multi-omics techniques into epidemiology research and translating findings into clinical practice.
